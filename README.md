Land Registry System - Blockchain-Based Solution

Overview

This project is a blockchain-based land registry system that ensures transparency, security, and immutability of land records. It utilizes Ethereum, smart contracts, and IPFS for decentralized and verifiable land ownership management.

Features

âœ… Immutable Land Records â€“ Prevent fraud and unauthorized changes.
âœ… Decentralized & Transparent â€“ Secure and accessible records.
âœ… Smart Contracts for Transactions â€“ Automate land ownership transfers.
âœ… Role-Based Access Control â€“ Government officials, buyers, and sellers have different permissions.
âœ… IPFS for Document Storage â€“ Secure and decentralized file storage.
âœ… User-Friendly DApp â€“ Web-based interface for interaction.

1. Platform & Technology Stack

Blockchain Platform:

-Ethereum (Private or Testnet Deployment) using Geth/Quorum/Besu

-Consensus Mechanism: Proof of Authority (PoA) for private networks

Smart Contract:

-Written in Solidity (v0.8.x)

-Manages property registration, verification, and ownership transfers

-Role-based access for government officials and users

Backend & API:

-Node.js with Express.js for API handling

-Web3.js for Ethereum interactions

-IPFS for storing property documents

-MongoDB/PostgreSQL for storing off-chain metadata

Frontend (DApp):

-React.js with Web3.js for blockchain interaction

-MetaMask integration for user authentication

-TailwindCSS for UI styling

2. Smart Contract Deployment

Installation

Ensure you have Node.js, Geth/Quorum, and Solidity installed.

npm install -g truffle
npm install web3 ipfs-http-client express mongoose

Compile & Deploy

  1. Compile Smart Contract

truffle compile

  2. Deploy to a Private Network or Testnet

truffle migrate --network development

  3. Interact with the contract

truffle console

3. Backend API Setup

Run Express API

node server.js

Available API Endpoints

   *POST /register-property â€“ Register a new property

   *POST /verify-property â€“ Verify a property (Only government officials)

   *POST /transfer-ownership â€“ Transfer ownership of a property

   *GET /property/:id â€“ Get property details

4. Frontend (DApp) Setup

Installation

cd client
npm install
npm start

DApp Features

Register Property â€“ Users can submit property details.

Verify Property â€“ Government officials can approve properties.

Transfer Ownership â€“ Owners can sell/transfer land.

View Land Records â€“ Anyone can check verified properties.

5. IPFS Integration

Upload Documents to IPFS

const ipfsClient = require('ipfs-http-client');
const ipfs = ipfsClient.create({ host: 'ipfs.infura.io', port: 5001, protocol: 'https' });

async function uploadFile(file) {
  const added = await ipfs.add(file);
  console.log(added.path);
}

6. Security & Governance

MultiSig Wallets for government approvals

Role-based permissions to prevent unauthorized actions

Data Encryption for sensitive off-chain storage

7. Future Enhancements

ðŸ”¹ NFT-Based Land Titles â€“ Convert property ownership into NFTs for easy transfers.ðŸ”¹ AI-Based Fraud Detection â€“ Identify double registrations or forged documents.ðŸ”¹ DeFi Integration â€“ Use blockchain for land-backed loans and mortgages.
